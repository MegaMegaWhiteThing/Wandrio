            <h2>Join Us: Turn Movement into Adventure</h2>
            <p>At Wandrio, we believe the world is meant to be explored—on foot, by bike, however you move. Our mission is to get people moving in nature more often by turning the outdoors into a game. With Wandrio, every step becomes an opportunity. We’ve built a movement-based tile collection game that rewards you for discovering new places, collecting virtual map tiles, and competing with friends and teams across real-world landscapes.</p>
            <p>Wandrio encourages daily activity by transforming walks, hikes, and bike rides into meaningful adventures. You earn points and unlock achievements just by visiting new places—whether it’s a hidden park in your neighborhood or a breathtaking hilltop you’ve never seen before. Explore natural landmarks, join exploration challenges, and compete in leagues—all while becoming more active.</p>
            <p>We're launching Wandrio to reconnect people with nature and their local environment. If you’d like to be among the first to experience it, please enter your email below to join our waiting list.</p>
