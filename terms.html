        <h1>Wandrio End User License Agreement</h1>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Please also review Wandrio’s <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</strong></p>
      </header>

      <p>
        The Wandrio service (the “Service”) is provided to the customer under the terms of this End User License Agreement (the “Agreement”). The Service is protected by copyright and/or other applicable laws. Use of the Service in violation of this Agreement is prohibited. The Service is provided by Wandrio Oy (“Wandrio”).
      </p>
      <p>
        By exercising the rights granted under this Agreement, the license recipient (the “User”) agrees to comply with its terms. Wandrio grants rights under this Agreement only on the condition that the User accepts its provisions and requirements. This Agreement may not be assigned (by the User).
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the map and route data included in the Service is intended to support the planning and execution of the User’s activities, and the Service does not guarantee the accuracy or correctness of such data. In particular, note that the roads and trails shown on maps provided by the Service are not official routes. The User is always responsible for complying with the law and for assessing the suitability of the data for any activity they undertake—e.g., to avoid hazardous situations or violating access restrictions or the right of public access.
      </p>

      <section id="copyright">
        <h2>1. Copyright and Ownership</h2>
        <p>Copyrights and other ownership rights in the Service are owned by Wandrio and/or its suppliers.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="user-content">
        <h2>2. Content Submitted by the User</h2>

        <p><strong>A)</strong> Users of the Service may publish, upload, and/or provide content to the Service (e.g., route and location data, descriptions of map server connection details, images, videos, texts, or other information). We refer to this content as “User Content.” The following terms and guidelines apply to User Content:</p>
        <ol type="A">
          <li>The User must not publish User Content in the Service if they do not have permission to publish it, if publishing it is unlawful, or if publishing it violates these agreements.</li>
          <li>Wandrio may monitor, review, or modify User Content. We may modify or remove User Content at any time for any reason without prior notice.</li>
          <li>The User is solely responsible for all User Content they publish.</li>
          <li>The User retains all copyrights and any other rights they may own in the User Content submitted to the Service. Further details on the processing of information the User submits to the Service can be found in the Service’s Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li>
            Some Service features are based on User Content, and therefore we require the specific rights set out below. By using the Service and creating User Content therein, you agree to grant Wandrio a license to your information and User Content under the following terms:
            <ul>
              <li>non-exclusive (you may provide the same information and terms to others),</li>
              <li>transferable (Wandrio may transfer the license you grant to another company, e.g., in connection with a business transaction),</li>
              <li>sublicensable (we may grant a license on the same or more limited terms to another company, e.g., Wandrio’s subcontractor),</li>
              <li>royalty-free (we will not pay you for the use of your information or User Content),</li>
              <li>perpetual (once you have submitted information or User Content to the Service, you cannot revoke this license).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Based on the license you grant, we have the right to use, copy, make publicly available, publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute all of your User Content related to the Service by any means, either separately or together with other content or materials, and in any manner, method, or technique.</li>
          <li>We will, where possible, display the nickname provided by the User in connection with the User Content. However, this cannot be guaranteed and may depend, among other things, on user interface optimization, aggregation of User Content, technical constraints, or other reasons.</li>
          <li>We continuously develop the Service and value feedback from our users. Please note that if you send us feedback, ideas, or other suggestions related to the Service and its content, such feedback is not confidential. We may use your feedback to improve the Service free of charge.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Rights Granted by the Licensor</h2>
        <p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Wandrio grants the User a worldwide, indefinite license to install and use the Service on any number of devices. All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by Wandrio.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>However, without separate permission, the User may publish Service content on a small scale—for example, post screenshots of the Service in a blog post or social media message. The User may also share on a small scale URL links to Service content, e.g., to route plans, without separate permission.</p>

      <section id="free-license">
        <h2>5. License to Free Parts of the Service</h2>

        <ol type="A">
          <li>You have the right to cancel your purchased subscription within 14 days of purchase. Because we provide access to the subscription immediately after purchase, in the event of cancellation, the price of the Service already used may be deducted from the refund. Cancellations must be sent to customer support at <a href="mailto:support@wandrioapp.com">support@wandrioapp.com</a>, which will remove access and process the refund.</li>
          <li>When purchasing a fixed-term (“billing period”) license to the Wandrio Plus service, you authorize the Service to automatically renew your purchase at the end of the billing period and to charge for the new billing period. If you wish to terminate the paid Service, you must do so before the start of the new billing period.</li>
          <li>If we change the price of paid Services, we will notify you in advance. Price changes take effect at the start of the new billing period following the change. You accept the new price by continuing to use the Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not accept the price change, you have the right to refuse it by cancelling the Wandrio Plus service before the price change takes effect.</li>
          <li>We may offer free or discounted trial periods for the Wandrio Plus service. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to determine your eligibility for a trial. We may also cancel or change your trial at any time. We have no obligation to notify you in advance of such cancellations or changes or to compensate for them in any way.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="warranty">
        <h2>8. Warranty</h2>

          <li>WANDRIO CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE. IN PARTICULAR, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT CALCULATION ERRORS MAY OCCUR WHEN USING THE SERVICE, FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO INCOMPLETE INFORMATION. WANDRIO IS ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ERRORS OR INCOMPLETENESS IN MAP DATA PROVIDED BY DATA SUPPLIERS.</li>
          <li>UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING OR REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE MANDATORY LAW, THE SERVICE IS LICENSED “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICE, ITS CONTENT, OR THE ACCURACY OF THE SERVICE.</li>

          <li>Wandrio reserves the right to terminate the Agreement or revoke your right to use the Wandrio service at any time.</li>
          <li>Upon termination of the Agreement or termination by Wandrio, you agree that Wandrio shall have no liabilities or obligations to the User, and any fees previously paid will not be refunded.</li>
          <li>Wandrio may update these terms by publishing updated terms on this page. Updated terms take effect immediately unless Wandrio expressly states a later effective date.
